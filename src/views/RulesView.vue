    <h2>This page will contain the rules catalogue</h2>
    <p>
      It will contain cards of all the differnt rules, similar to
      <a href="https://elastic.github.io/detection-rules-explorer/">elastic-rules</a>
      with filtering functionality. <br />To do this, we need to generate a large JSON of the
      submodule capa-rules using a CI routine. <br />After that, the rules cards will be displayed
      here.
